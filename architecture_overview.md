## Core Architecture Overview
The agent uses a modular pipeline to analyze the problem, assess the user's knowledge, scaffold learning, and provide feedback. Here's a breakdown:

| **Module**             | **Function**                                                               |
|------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| User Interface         | Mobile/web app for input (text, voice, images) and interaction.            |
| Problem Understanding  | Analyzes the user's question (subject, topic, complexity).                 |
| Knowledge Assessment   | Diagnoses the user's current understanding (pre-test or historical data).  |
| Scaffolding Engine     | Breaks the problem into steps with hints/questions.                        |
| Feedback & Correction  | Detects errors and provides constructive feedback.                         |
| Knowledge Reinforcement| Summarizes key concepts and suggests practice problems.                    |



## Detailed Module Design

### A. Problem Understanding Module
**Input:** User’s question (e.g., “Solve 2x + 5 = 15”).

**Process:**
1. **NLP Pipeline:** Extract entities, keywords, and problem type (e.g., algebra).
2. **Knowledge Mapping:** Link to curriculum/concepts (e.g., linear equations).

**Output:** Structured problem schema (domain, sub-topic, required skills).

### B. Knowledge Assessment Module
**Diagnostic Questions:**
1. Ask foundational questions (e.g., “What does the ‘=’ sign mean in an equation?”).
2. Use LLM-generated probes to gauge prior knowledge.

**Adaptive Check:** Adjust scaffolding based on gaps (e.g., reteach basics first).

### C. Scaffolding Engine
**Step-by-Step Breakdown:**
1. Decompose the problem into sub-tasks (e.g., “Isolate the variable” → “Subtract 5” → “Divide by 2”).

**Guided Interaction:**
1. **Hint System:** Provide incremental hints (e.g., “What operation undoes addition?”).
2. **Socratic Questioning:** Use LLM to generate leading questions (e.g., “What should you do to both sides to balance the equation?”).

**Strict Policy:** LLM prompt-engineered to never give answers (e.g., system role: “You are a tutor who only asks questions and gives hints”).

### D. Feedback & Correction Module
**Error Detection:**
1. Compare user’s intermediate steps to expected reasoning (e.g., using verification LLMs).
2. Flag misconceptions (e.g., “You subtracted 5 from only one side. What’s the rule for balancing equations?”).

**Positive Reinforcement:** Acknowledge correct steps to build confidence.

### E. Knowledge Reinforcement Module
**Concept Review:** Post-solve, summarize key takeaways (e.g., “Balancing equations ensures equality”).

**Practice Generator:** Use LLM to create similar problems for mastery.

## Feedback & Correction Module
- **Purpose**: Real-time error analysis and adaptive feedback
- **Key Features**:
  - Error pattern recognition
  - Tiered feedback system (immediate vs. strategic)
  - Corrective exercise generation
  - Progress tracking
- **Integration Points**:
  - Receives input from Problem Understanding and Knowledge Assessment
  - Feeds into Scaffolding Engine for path adjustments

## Knowledge Reinforcement Module
- **Purpose**: Long-term retention through adaptive spacing
- **Key Features**:
  - Spaced repetition scheduling
  - Varied practice generation
  - Retention modeling
  - Cross-concept linking
- **Integration Points**:
  - Receives input from all previous modules
  - Feeds into practice generation systems
  - Updates student progress models

## Example Interaction Flow

**User Input:** “How do I solve 2x + 5 = 15?”

**Problem Understanding:** Identifies linear equations, algebra domain.

**Knowledge Assessment:** Asks, “What does the ‘=’ sign mean here?”

**Scaffolding:**
1. Step 1: “What can you do to isolate the term with x?”
2. Step 2: “How do you undo adding 5?”

**Feedback:** “Great! Now, what should you do to both sides after subtracting 5?”

**Reinforcement:** Reviews balancing equations and suggests practice.

## Tools & Tech Stack

**LLM Backbone:** GPT-4, Llama-3, or Mistral for reasoning.

**NLP Libraries:** SpaCy/NLTK for problem parsing.

**App Framework:** Streamlit/Gradio for prototyping, React Native for mobile.

**Evaluation:** Track metrics like step completion rate, error correction success, and user feedback.

## LLM Integration Strategy

### Prompt Engineering:

Use system-level instructions to enforce tutoring behavior (e.g., “Never solve the problem for the user. Only ask questions or give hints.”).

**Example prompt:**
```
You are a patient tutor teaching a student. The student asks: "{question}".  
Respond with a guiding question or hint to help them think step-by-step.  
Do NOT provide direct answers.
```

## Key Flow

1. User Input → Problem Analysis → Knowledge Check → Guided Steps → Feedback Loop → Reinforcement.

2. LLMs power critical modules (highlighted with LLM-Powered/LLM-Generated).

3. Strict policies prevent direct answers (enforced via prompts and validation layers).
