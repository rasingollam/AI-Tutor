Okay, so I have this equation to solve: 2(n + 3) = 4n - 2. Hmm, let me think about how to approach this. I remember that solving linear equations usually involves getting all the variables on one side and the constants on the other. 

First, I think I need to simplify both sides of the equation. On the left side, there's a distributive property involved because of the 2 multiplied by (n + 3). So, I should distribute the 2 to both n and 3. That would give me 2n + 6. So now, the equation becomes 2n + 6 = 4n - 2.

Wait, let me make sure I did that correctly. Yes, 2 times n is 2n, and 2 times 3 is 6. So that's correct. Now, I have 2n + 6 on the left and 4n - 2 on the right.

Next, I think I need to get all the n terms on one side and the constants on the other. Maybe I can subtract 2n from both sides to get rid of it on the left. So, subtracting 2n from both sides would give me 6 = 2n - 2. Let me check that: 2n + 6 - 2n is 6, and 4n - 2 - 2n is 2n - 2. Yep, that looks right.

Now, I have 6 = 2n - 2. I need to isolate the term with n. So, I should get rid of the -2 on the right side. To do that, I can add 2 to both sides. Adding 2 to both sides gives me 8 = 2n. Let me verify: 6 + 2 is 8, and 2n - 2 + 2 is 2n. Correct.

Now, I have 8 = 2n. To solve for n, I need to divide both sides by 2. Dividing both sides by 2 gives me 4 = n. Alternatively, I can write it as n = 4. Let me check that: 2n would be 8, so 8 divided by 2 is 4. Yep, that makes sense.

Wait, let me double-check by plugging n = 4 back into the original equation to make sure it works. Original equation: 2(n + 3) = 4n - 2. Plugging in n = 4: Left side is 2(4 + 3) = 2(7) = 14. Right side is 4(4) - 2 = 16 - 2 = 14. Both sides equal 14, so it checks out. 

I think I did everything correctly. I distributed, moved variables to one side, isolated the variable, and checked my solution. It all seems to make sense. I don't think I made any mistakes, but it's always good to go through each step again to be sure.

So, to recap: I started by distributing the 2, then moved the 2n to the right side, added 2 to both sides to isolate 2n, and then divided by 2 to find n = 4. Everything checks out when I substitute back into the original equation. I think I'm confident with this solution.
</think>

To solve the equation \(2(n + 3) = 4n - 2\), follow these steps:

1. **Distribute the 2 on the left side:**
   \[
   2n + 6 = 4n - 2
   \]
   - This simplifies the equation by expanding the terms.

2. **Subtract \(2n\) from both sides to move all \(n\) terms to one side:**
   \[
   6 = 2n - 2
   \]
   - This step isolates the variable term on the right side.

3. **Add 2 to both sides to isolate the term with \(n\):**
   \[
   8 = 2n
   \]
   - This step removes the constant from the right side.

4. **Divide both sides by 2 to solve for \(n\):**
   \[
   n = 4
   \]
   - This step finds the value of \(n\).

5. **Verify the solution by substituting \(n = 4\) back into the original equation:**
   - Left side: \(2(4 + 3) = 2(7) = 14\)
   - Right side: \(4(4) -
