2025-02-21 12:37:32,048 - image_processor - DEBUG - Raw API response: The image contains a handwritten math problem. The problem is:

2(2x + 5) = 7x - 23

This is a linear equation, specifically a quadratic equation in disguise. The problem type is a quadratic equation.

To convert the handwritten text into a clear digital format, I will transcribe it as follows:

{
    "problem_text": "2(2x + 5) = 7x - 23",
    "problem_type": "Quadratic Equation",

2025-02-21 12:39:25,770 - image_processor - DEBUG - Raw API response: The image contains a handwritten math problem, which reads: "Solve n for: 2(n+5) = 7n - 23." This is a linear equation problem.

To solve for n, we can start by distributing the 2 on the left side of the equation:

2n + 10 = 7n - 23

Next, we can subtract 2n from both sides to get:

10 = 5n - 23

Then, we can add 23 to both sides to get:

33 = 5n

Finally, we can divide both sides by 5 to solve for n:

n = 33/5

Therefore, the solution to the equation is n = 6.6.

Here is the response in the requested format:

2025-02-21 12:39:39,287 - image_processor - DEBUG - Raw API response: The image contains a handwritten math problem, which reads: "Solve u for: 2(u+5) = 7u - 23." This is a quadratic equation, specifically a linear equation in one variable. The problem asks to solve for the variable "u".

To solve this equation, we can start by expanding the left side using the distributive property:

2(u + 5) = 2u + 10

Now, we can set up the equation as follows:

2u + 10 = 7u - 23

Next, we can subtract 2u from both sides to get:

10 = 5u - 23

Then, we can add 23 to both sides to get:

33 = 5u

Finally, we can divide both sides by 5 to solve for u:

u = 33/5

Therefore, the solution to the equation is u = 6.6.

In summary, the problem is a quadratic equation in one variable, and the solution is u = 6.6.

2025-02-21 12:52:09,256 - image_processor - DEBUG - Raw vision model response: The math problem in the image is:

2(5 + n) = 7n - 23

This equation can be solved by first distributing the 2 to the terms inside the parentheses, resulting in:

10 + 2n = 7n - 23

Next, we can add 23 to both sides of the equation to get:

10 + 2n + 23 = 7n - 23 + 23

Simplifying this expression gives us:

33 + 2n = 7n

Subtracting 2n from both sides yields:

33 = 5n

Finally, dividing both sides by 5 results in:

n = 33/5

Therefore, the solution to the equation is n = 33/5.

In JSON format, the math problem and its solution can be represented as follows:

2025-02-21 12:54:32,375 - image_processor - DEBUG - Raw vision model response: The math problem in the image is:

10 + 23 = 7x - 2x

This equation can be solved by combining like terms on the right side of the equation. 

7x - 2x = 5x

So, the equation becomes:

10 + 23 = 5x

Combine the constants on the left side of the equation:

33 = 5x

Now, divide both sides by 5 to solve for x:

x = 33 / 5

x = 6.6

Therefore, the solution to the math problem is x = 6.6.

10 + 2 * 3 = 7n - 2n
33 = 5n

This problem involves algebraic equations and requires solving for the variable 'n'. The first equation can be simplified to 16 = 5n, and the second equation is already in a simple form. To solve for 'n', we can divide both sides of the first equation by 5, which gives us n = 16/5. This value of 'n' satisfies both equations.

In JSON format, the problem would be represented as:

2(n+3) = 4n - 2

This equation can be solved by expanding and simplifying both sides. 

First, expand the left side of the equation:

2n + 6 = 4n - 2

Next, subtract 2n from both sides to get:

6 = 2n - 2

Then, add 2 to both sides to get:

8 = 2n

Finally, divide both sides by 2 to solve for n:

n = 4

Therefore, the solution to the equation is n = 4.
