    "confidence": 0.95
}

**Explanation:**

The image displays a sequence of algebraic equations, each with its corresponding solution. The equations are:

* 2(n+3) = 4n - 2
* 2n + 6 = 4n - 2
* (2n + 6) - 2n = (4n - 2) - 2n
* 6 = 2n - 2
* 6 + 2 = (2n - 2) + 2
* 8 = 2n

The final equation, 8 = 2n, is the solution to the previous equations

* **Answer Text**: 6
* **Explanation**: The image shows a simple arithmetic equation: 6x + 10 = 6. To solve for x, we subtract 10 from both sides of the equation, resulting in 6x = -4. Then, we divide both sides by 6 to isolate x, giving us x = -4/6. Simplifying this fraction, we get x = -2/3. However, the provided answer is 6, which does not match the solution to the equation.

* **Answer Text**: (2n + 2) - 7 = 15 - 7, 2n = 8
* **Explanation**: The image shows a simple algebraic equation being solved step by step. The equation starts as (2n + 2) - 7 = 15 - 7, which simplifies to 2n + 2 - 7 = 8. By further simplifying, we get 2n - 5 = 8. Adding 5 to both sides gives us 2n = 13. However, the provided solution incorrectly states 2n = 8, indicating an error in the calculation.
