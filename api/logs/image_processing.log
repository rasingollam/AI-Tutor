    "confidence": 0.95
}

**Explanation:**

The image displays a sequence of algebraic equations, each with its corresponding solution. The equations are:

* 2(n+3) = 4n - 2
* 2n + 6 = 4n - 2
* (2n + 6) - 2n = (4n - 2) - 2n
* 6 = 2n - 2
* 6 + 2 = (2n - 2) + 2
* 8 = 2n

The final equation, 8 = 2n, is the solution to the previous equations
